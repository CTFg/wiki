When playing a CTF, you are on the look out for *flags*. A flag usually looks something like this:

```
flag{some_message}
```

There is a standardized format of `flag{...}` where the inside of the brackets can have any message inside of it. 

When you find one of these flags, go to the competition website to enter it.

If you want to enter evidence that is not a flag, please uncheck the "Submitting a flag " box as shown below:
