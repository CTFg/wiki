title: Solving MCPSHSF on a Chromebook
---
Although it is possible to solve MCPSHSF challenges on a Chromebook, it is difficult. This is because Chromebooks do not support the use of virtual machines, which are necessary for solving many challenges. However, there are some ways to solve challenges on a Chromebook. In this guide, we will go over the different ways to solve challenges on a Chromebook.

## Using a Linux VM
We provide a Linux VM that you can use to solve challenges on a Chromebook. This VM is based on Ubuntu and is preconfigured with all the tools you need to solve MCPSHSF challenges. You can also install any other tools you need with `apt`. The url to your team's VM is listed on the team page. The password is also listed there.

## Web Tools
There are some web tools that you can use to solve challenges on a Chromebook. These tools are not as powerful as the VM, but they can still be used to solve challenges. The web tools are listed below:
* [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)
* [Spectrogram Viewer](https://academo.org/demos/spectrum-analyzer/)
* [Metadata Viewer](https://www.geekyhumans.com/tools/image-metadata-viewer)
* [Steghide](https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html)
* [Hex Editor](https://hexed.it/)
* [Cloudshark](https://www.qacafe.com/analysis-tools/cloudshark/)
    * Used for viewing pcap files
* [Replit](https://replit.com/)
    * Used for coding quick scripts in Python
* [LSB Steganography](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/)
* [Git Visualizer](https://github.com)
    * Create a new repository and upload your files to it. Then, go to the Insights tab and click on the Network tab. This will show you a visual representation of the commits you made to the repository.

## Stipulations
Unfortunately, memory forensics challenges cannot be solved on a Chromebook. This is because there are no web tools that can be used to solve memory forensics challenges. Also, some challenges cannot be solved using web tools, and must be solved using CLI tools. However, you can still solve these challenges using the desktop provided to your Team.
