## What is Linux?
Linux is an operating system, just like Windows or Mac OS. It is a free and open source operating system, meaning that anyone can use it, modify it, and distribute it. Linux is used on many different devices, including servers, desktops, and even phones. Linux is also used in many different places, including NASA, the US Department of Defense, and even the International Space Station. In cybersecurity, Linux is used to host servers, and to run tools that are used to solve challenges.

## Executing Commands
In Linux, commands are executed in the terminal. The terminal is a program that allows you to execute commands. The terminal is also known as the command line interface (CLI). Some example commands are `ls`, `cd`, and `pwd`. These commands are used to list files, change directories, and print the working directory, respectively. The terminal is also used to execute programs. For example, the command `python3` is used to execute the Python 3 interpreter. The terminal is also used to install programs. For example, the command `sudo apt install python3` is used to install Python 3.
