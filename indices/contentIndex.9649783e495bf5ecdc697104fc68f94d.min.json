Files can also contain additional \"hidden\" data called *metadata* which can be useful in finding out information about the context of a file's data.\n\n## File Signatures\n\n**File signatures** (also known as File Magic Numbers) are bytes within a file used to identify the format of the file. Generally they’re 2-4 bytes long, found at the beginning of a file.\n\n### What is it used for?\n\nFiles can sometimes come without an extension, or with incorrect ones. We use file signature analysis to identify the format (file type) of the file. Programs need to know the file type in order to open it properly.\n\n### How do you find the file signature?\n\nYou need to be able to look at the binary data that constitutes the file you’re examining. To do this, you’ll use a hexadecimal editor. Once you find the file signature, you can check it against file signature repositories [such as Gary Kessler’s](http://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html).\n\n### Example\n\n![File A](/images/file-a.jpg)\n\nThe file above, when opened in a Hex Editor, begins with the bytes `FFD8FFE0 00104A46 494600` or in ASCII `ˇÿˇ‡  JFIF` where `\\x00` and `\\x10` lack symbols. \n\nSearching in [Gary Kessler’s](http://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html) database shows that this file signature belongs to a `JPEG/JFIF graphics file`, exactly what we suspect.\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T02:53:51.634137199Z","tags":null},"/forensics/what-is-a-hex-editor":{"title":"What is a hex editor?","content":"\nA hexadecimal (hex) editor (also called a binary file editor or byte editor) is a computer program you can use to manipulate the fundamental binary data that constitutes a computer file. The name “hex” comes from “hexadecimal,” a standard numerical format for representing binary data. A typical computer file occupies multiple areas on the platter(s) of a disk drive, whose contents are combined to form the file. Hex editors that are designed to parse and edit sector data from the physical segments of floppy or hard disks are sometimes called sector editors or disk editors. A hex editor is used to see or edit the raw, exact contents of a file. Hex editors may used to correct data corrupted by a system or application. You can find an online hex editor at https://hexed.it/, or you can download one of the [many ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_hex_editors) freely available.\n\n### Example\n\nOpen fileA.jpg in a hex editor.

It’s also common to calculate a cryptographic hash of the entire disk when imaging it. “Commonly-used cryptographic hashes are MD5, SHA1 and/or SHA256,” said Wikipedia. “By recalculating the integrity hash at a later time, one can determine if the data in the disk image has been changed. This by itself provides no protection against intentional tampering, but it can indicate that the data was altered, e.g. due to corruption.”\n\nWhy image a disk?

If the MAC timestamps can be attained, a timeline of events could be created.\n\n### Timeline Patterns\nThere are plenty more patterns than the ones introduced below, but these are the basics you should start with to get a good understanding of how it works, and to complete this challenge.\n\n![Timeline 1](/images/timeline-1.png)\n![Timeline 2](/images/timeline-2.png)\n![Timeline 3](/images/timeline-3.png)\n![Timeline 4](/images/timeline-4.png)\n![Timeline 5](/images/timeline-5.png)\n\n### Examples\n\nWe know that the BMP files fileA and fileD are the same, but that the JPEG files fileB and fileC are different somehow. So how can we find out what went on with these files?\n\n![Files A, B, C, D](/images/file-a-b-c-d.png)\n\nBy using time stamp information from the file system, we can learn that the BMP fileD was the original file, with fileA being a copy of the original. Afterward, fileB was created by modifying fileB, and fileC was created by modifying fileA in a different way.\n\nFollow along as we demonstrate.\n\nWe’ll start by analyzing images in AccessData FTK Imager, where there’s a Properties window that shows you some information about the file or folder you’ve selected.\n\n![Timestamp 1](/images/timestamp-1.png)\n![Timestamp 2](/images/timestamp-2.png)\n![Timestamp 3](/images/timestamp-3.png)\n![Timestamp 4](/images/timestamp-4.png)\n\nHere are the extracted MAC times for fileA, fileB, fileC and fileD:\n*Note, AccessData FTK Imager assumes that the file times on the drive are in UTC (Universal Coordinated Time).

Stegonagraphy is often embedded in images or audio.\n\nYou could send a picture of a cat to a friend and hide text inside. Looking at the image, there’s nothing to make anyone think there’s a message hidden inside it.\n\n![Steg with text](/images/steg-cat-text.png)\n\nYou could also hide a second image inside the first.\n\n![Steg with an Image](/images/steg-cat-image.png)\n\n## Stegonagraphy Detection\n\nSo we can hide text and an image, how do we find out if there is hidden data?\n\n![Group of images](/images/steg-a-b-c-d.png)\n\nFileA and FileD appear the same, but they’re different. Also, FileD was modified after it was copied, so it’s possible there might be steganography in it.\n\nFileB and FileC don’t appear to have been modified after being created. That doesn’t rule out the possibility that there’s steganography in them, but you’re more likely to find it in fileD. This brings up two questions:\n\n1. Can we determine that there is steganography in fileD?\n2. If there is, what was hidden in it?\n\n## LSB Stegonagraphy\n\nFile are made of bytes. Each byte is composed of eight bits.\n\n![Steganography Process Step 1](/images/steg-step-1.png)\n\nChanging the least-significant bit (LSB) doesn’t change the value very much.\n\n![Steganography Process Step 2](/images/steg-step-2.png)\n\nSo we can modify the LSB without changing the file noticeably. By doing so, we can hide a message inside.\n\n### LSB Stegonagraphy in Images\n\nLSB Stegonagraphy or *Least Significant Bit* Stegonagraphy is a method of stegonagraphy where data is recorded in the lowest bit of a byte.\n\nSay an image has a pixel with an RGB value of (255, 255, 255), the bits of those RGB values will look like\n\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\nBy modifying the lowest, or least significant, bit, we can use the 1 bit space across every RGB value for every pixel to construct a message.\n\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\nThe reason stegonagraphy is hard to detect by sight is because a 1 bit difference in color is insignificant as seen below.\n\n![1 Bit Difference](/images/lsb-color-difference.png)\n\n### Example\n\nLet’s say we have an image, and part of it contains the following binary:\n\n![Steganography Process Step 3](/images/steg-step-3.png)\n\nAnd let’s say we want to hide the character y inside.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the hidden message to binary.\n\n![Steganography Process Step 4](/images/steg-step-4.png)\n\nNow we take each bit from the hidden message and replace the LSB of the corresponding byte with it.\n\n![Steganography Process Step 5](/images/steg-step-5.png)\n\nAnd again:\n\n![Steganography Process Step 6](/images/steg-step-6.png)\n\nAnd again:\n\n![Steganography Process Step 7](/images/steg-step-7.png)\n\nAnd again:\n\n![Steganography Process Step 8](/images/steg-step-8.png)\n\nAnd again:\n\n![Steganography Process Step 9](/images/steg-step-9.png)\n\nAnd again:\n\n![Steganography Process Step 10](/images/steg-step-10.png)\n\nAnd again:\n\n![Steganography Process Step 11](/images/steg-step-11.png)\n\nAnd once more:\n\n![Steganography Process Step 12](/images/steg-step-12.png)\n\nDecoding LSB steganography is exactly the same as encoding, but in reverse. For each byte, grab the LSB and add it to your decoded message. Once you’ve gone through each byte, convert all the LSBs you grabbed into text or a file. (You can use your file signature knowledge here!)\n\n## Audio Steganography\n\nLSB Steganography can be used for more than just images; it can also be used for audio files! Another popular technique is to hide text in the spectrogram of an audio file. This shown below:\n\n![Spectrogram](/images/spectrogram.png)\n\n## What other types of steganography are there?\nSteganography is hard for the defense side, because there’s practically an infinite number of ways it could be carried out. Here are a few examples:\n- LSB steganography: different bits, different bit combinations\n- Encode in every certain number of bytes \n- Use a password\n- Hide in different places\n- Use encryption on top of steganography","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T02:53:51.634137199Z","tags":null},"/forensics/what-is-wireshark":{"title":"What is wireshark?","content":"\n[Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.com) is a network protocol analyzer which is often used in CTF challenges to look at recorded network traffic.

In order to filter by IP, ensure a double equals '==' is used. \n\n![PCAP HTTP IP Filter](/images/ws-filter-2.png)\n\nThe most pertinent part of a packet is its data payload and protocol information.\n\n![HTTP TCP Info](/images/ws-tcp-http-info.png)\n\n## Decrypting SSL Traffic\n\nBy default, Wireshark cannot decrypt SSL traffic on your device unless you grant it specific certificates.\n\n### High Level SSL Handshake Overview\n\nIn order for a network session to be encrypted properly, the client and server must share a common secret for which they can use to encrypt and decrypt data without someone in the middle being able to guess. The SSL Handshake loosely follows this format:\n\n1. The client sends a list of availble cipher suites it can use along with a random set of bytes referred to as client_random\n2. The server sends back the cipher suite that will be used, such as TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, along with a random set of bytes referred to as server_random\n3. The client generates a pre-master secret, encrypts it, then sends it to the server.\n4. The server and client then generate a common master secret using the selected cipher suite\n5. The client and server begin communicating using this common secret\n\n### Decryption Requirements\n\nThere are several ways to be able to decrypt traffic.\n\n- If you have the client and server random values *and* the pre-master secret, the master secret can be generated and used to decrypt the traffic\n- If you have the master secret, traffic can be decrypted easily\n- If the cipher-suite uses RSA, you can factor *n* in the key in order to break the encryption on the encrypted pre-master secret and generate the master secret with the client and server randoms \n\n![Wireshark SSL Preferences](/images/ws-ssl-pref.png)","lastmodified":"2023-03-13T02:53:51.634137199Z","tags":null}}
